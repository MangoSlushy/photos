  <h1>Welcom to my photo gallery!</h1>
  <p>
    Using this opportunity to learn web developement and to have my very own site (thanks Github) for my photos.
    Don't expect anything fancy for now.
    Just some basic web layouts.
    Hopefully this turns out well.
    <br />Thanks for viewing by the way!
